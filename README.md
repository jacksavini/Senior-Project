# SeniorProject
This is code from my senior project, which encrypts and decrypts messages using the Khan and Shah cipher method.
This code was written to compliment a presentation I made on the K&S cipher. You can see me present my Senior Project using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OME661sWCJ0
